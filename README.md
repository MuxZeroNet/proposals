Proposals
---------

Use the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/MuxZeroNet/proposals/issues) and the [Wiki](https://github.com/MuxZeroNet/proposals/wiki) to draft your proposals regarding how to improve ZeroNet and its peripheral services. While proposals may influence the development of ZeroNet, this repository is unofficial.

I informally define three different types of ZEPs.

- **Standards**  
    Describes a new feature or implementation.

- **Informational**  
    Describes a ZeroNet design issue, or provides general guidelines or information to the ZeroNet community, but does not propose a new feature.

- **Process**  
    Describe changes in ZeroNet, which readers are typically not free to ignore them.

## Expressing your idea regrading ZeroNet

It is highly recommended that a single proposal contains a single key idea. Proposals that are too broad or ambiguous are less likely to make their way into the official specification.

Posting your idea to the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/MuxZeroNet/proposals/issues) for discussion before actually writing or editing a ZEP saves the authorsâ€™ time. Doing so also makes sure the proposal is applicable and acceptable to the entire ZeroNet community, not just to the authors.

A proposal should either formally or informally follow the content guideline. Use common sense. Be helpful and constructive. Write for the entire community, not just for yourself. Don't say "I want this" without actually thinking about how to implement the said ideas.
